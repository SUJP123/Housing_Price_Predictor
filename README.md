# Housing Prices Prediction

Housing Prices Prediction is a full stack machine learning project that uses data from Zillow and the Federal Bank of St Louis to predict 
metrics such as future housing prices, adjusted prices, and adjusted values. This website uses a Django Backend and React.js for the front end,
and allows users to select a state, city, and months ahead to view how the algorithim will predict future housing prices. 

This model can be locally hosted once downloaded, and is a Django application. The main predictor used for this model was the Scikit-Learn Library with a Random Forest Regressor to make housing price predictions. The databases can be configured by going to the Zillow website and the corresponding Federal Bank of St Louis Sites and grabbing the CSV data and updating the model.
