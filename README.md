Housing Prices Prediction is a full stack machine learning project that uses data from Zillow and the Federal Bank of St Louis to predict 
metrics such as future housing prices, adjusted prices, and adjusted values. This website uses a Django Backend and React.js for the front end,
and allows users to select a state, city, and months ahead to view how the algorithim will predict future housing prices.
